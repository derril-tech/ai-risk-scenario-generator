AI Risk Scenario Generator — runs “what if” analysis across financial, supply chain, cyber threats 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 

“Stress-test your organization with AI-driven ‘what if’ scenarios that simulate financial, supply chain, and cyber risks—and generate actionable resilience plans.” 

What it produces 

Risk scenarios: narrative + data-driven simulation across domains (finance, ops, cyber). 

Impact matrices: likelihood × severity × time-to-recover. 

Monte Carlo / stochastic models: probability curves, tail risks, sensitivity analyses. 

Causal maps: chain reactions (e.g., supplier outage → production delay → revenue dip). 

Mitigation packs: prioritized actions, budget tradeoffs, fallback suppliers, cyber hardening. 

Exports: scenario deck (PDF), JSON simulation outputs, CSV of key assumptions, interactive dashboards. 

Scope/Safety 

Decision-support, not a substitute for certified financial/cyber/legal risk officers. 

Models grounded in historical + organizational data; human review required. 

Guardrails to prevent misrepresentation of regulatory/market predictions. 

 

2) Target User 

CROs / CFOs / CISOs needing cross-domain resilience planning. 

Enterprise risk management (ERM) teams modeling tail-risk exposure. 

Boards & executives requiring scenario packs for strategy. 

Consultancies / auditors offering risk-as-a-service. 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive) 

Ingestion & Data Context 

Connectors: ERP (SAP, Oracle), Finance (NetSuite, QuickBooks), Supply chain (SAP Ariba, Coupa), Cyber (SIEMs, EDRs), Public (Bloomberg feeds, customs/ports data). 

Static uploads: CSV/XLSX (financials, supplier lists, asset inventories), PDFs (risk policies, reports). 

Data normalization into risk ontology: asset → threat → impact. 

Scenario Generation 

What-if templates: 

Financial: liquidity crunch, FX rate spike, credit downgrade. 

Supply chain: Tier-1/Tier-2 supplier outage, port strike, transport fuel hike. 

Cyber: ransomware, insider data theft, DDoS, third-party SaaS compromise. 

AI narrative: CrewAI/LangChain agent produces scenario text, contextualized to org. 

Quant models: Monte Carlo sims, Bayesian nets, stress-test curves. 

Dependencies: link events across domains (“cyber attack on logistics → supply chain stall → revenue hit”). 

Assumptions panel: clearly stated drivers (interest rate +200 bps, supplier offline 4 weeks). 

Analysis & Visualization 

Impact matrix (likelihood vs severity) auto-populated per scenario. 

Causal diagrams with arrows + probabilities. 

Loss curves: histograms of modeled outcomes (5th–95th percentile). 

Heatmaps: business unit, region, supplier risk exposure. 

Comparison mode: baseline vs mitigated risk scenario. 

Mitigation & Playbooks 

Option sets: diversify suppliers, renegotiate FX hedges, invest in SOC hardening. 

Cost–benefit models: compare mitigation expense vs avoided loss. 

SOAR/SRM integration: push tasks to ServiceNow, Jira, GRC platforms. 

Policy templates: fallback procedures, escalation trees. 

Reporting & Governance 

Export board packs (slides, PDFs), regulator packs (ISO 31000, NIST RMF). 

SLA tracking for mitigation plans. 

Audit logs of scenario assumptions + data provenance.
